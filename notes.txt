1/4
Following this JAMstack course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_l0qrPUJds&t=9592s
The jamstack way would be ->
CMS content is published to REST API
Static Site Generator (SSG) utilizes the API content in a page build
Static page is pushed to CDN for hosting, pre-rendered by the SSG
---> And in this case, static page contains the "click" listener to run the POST method on a separate express server

- Putting this on hold to see if I can learn Next.js to use as a static site generator /and/ Node.js+Express server for this project

For 1/4
- clear my node vulnerabilities (npm audit) - and make sure my apps still work
- How does the server retrieve the choices from the CMS? It needs to keep an updated list stored in choices.json.
- It would be possible to have the client app retrieve them and push them to the server on every access, but that doesn't seem ideal - the server should be trusted to have them
- Make an html form snippet in HTML-CSS-Layout-Snippets

1/3
- Make a plan for CMS integration - how will CMS data become choices in the poll?
    - Server needs to contain a storage file for the "Choices" (CMS data for each item: Title/Image/VotingLabel/anything else?)
    - This can be housed in a separate key of data.json, or there can be a "choices.json" and a "results.json"
- Add node autorefresh to this project

For voting page
- Rebuild the voting form in a way that makes any more sense to me?

For server
- See if there is a more appropriate CORS implementation
