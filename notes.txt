For voting page
- Build the voting form in a way that makes sense to me

For authtest page
- Make the results show in DOM after a successful login
- Do something in the DOM on unsuccessful login

For server
- Make data processing output include for each choice - total current votes, current percentage...and in a separate key? total votes
- Valid credentials are currently stored in index.js (if (!(username === "ben" && password === "my-favorite-password")) {}) - break the login validation into a separate function
